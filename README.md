char* Name(); // returns a pointer to a null terminated string containing the modules name  
char* Help(); // retrurns a pointer to a null terminated string containing a help message 
DWORD Run(DWORD argc, CHAR** argv); // Primary entry point for the module. this runs the command and outputs a DWORD


```
